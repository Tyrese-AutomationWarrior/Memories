## Introduction

- In earlier days people used to maintain diaries.
- But those days have changed, but our needs still remain the same.
- This is a WebApp helps suffice the need for a digital diary and help improve the user Experience.
- The Anime [Kimi no Na wa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name) gave me inspiration to improve this project every bit.
