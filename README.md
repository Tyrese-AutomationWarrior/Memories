## Introduction

-   In earlier days people used to store their valuable memories in Diaries.
-   Days have changed, but needs of people still remain the same.
-   This is a WebApp helps suffice the need for a Digital Diary and help improve the user Experience.
-   The Anime [Kimi no Na wa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name) gave me inspiration to improve this project every bit.
